About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):
1.Merging Data
  1.1 Create a folder in which the data will downloaded
       1.1.1 Downloading the file
       1.1.2 Unzip files and list files
  1.2 Read features files
  1.3 Read Subject files
  1.4 Read Activity files
  1.5 Read Features Names
  1.6 Read Activity labels
  1.7 Merge Data the three Data frames
  1.8 Rename Columns in Activity_Data and Activity_Labels
     1.8.0 Get factor of Activity_names
  1.9 Rename Columns
      Rename FeaturesData columns using columns from FeaturesNames
      Rename SubjectData columns
  1.9.0 Create one large Dataset with only these variables: SubjectData,  Activity,  FeaturesData
2. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Rename the columns of the large dataset using more descriptive activity names
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
   5.1 Save this tidy dataset to local file
